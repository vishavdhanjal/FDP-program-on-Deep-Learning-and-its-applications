Lake View Park,Response about 3 guests,"Everything is good. But when we went for check-in with 3 guests, their mindset is as if they are allowing the extra person free even we paid money for him. Everything is awesome over there but the approach for 3 guests is not up to the mark.",3,86,,,,

One of the main services I expected from their brochure is the provision of WiFi. But unfortunately the one provided was not working. So our stay for two days ended up with lot of inconvenience.",3,71,,,,
Crystal Residency,Very close to Chennai consulate,"This is a great place to stay if your here for the visa interview. Biometric and visa interview is really close. Food and service was also pretty good. These are the only positives. The room is small and shabby. The AC has no regulator. The beds are average. The loo was badly kept. But all in all, it depends on why and with whom you are there. Serves the purpose if visa is why you are there.",3,71,,,,
Crystal Residency,It is good experience altogether,It was good experience altogether. Hotel was near to US Consulate Office and comfortable to stay as well. I would strongly recommend this.

Crystal Residency,Average hotel at good location,"It was good location but hotel is average. Need to improve service specially regarding cleanliness. Rooms are spacious, the executive one but bed sheets are very old and towels are also not up to the mark.",2,57,,,,
Crystal Residency,Joseph,The room was very old and we requested for alternate room in the new which was at first confirmed by the hotel management however the same was not provided at all. Had problems with the AC and it was frequently getting dripped off. The only good thing is the location as this hotel is at walkable distance from the US consulate.,2,57,,,,
Mallika Reisidency,,"The first room we were given had a big rat. The room was finally changed after we told the staff about the incident. Overall, the hotel is ok for the price we paid. The place is close to Marina Beach, TTDC Headquarters, Main market. Plenty of eateries nearby.",2,60,,,,
Mallika Reisidency,Review by vijay kumar experience for 4 days & 4 nightes,"The hotel is located at narrow street it does not have enough space to park vehicles, no signals for mobiles in hotel.

Dee Cee Manor,Very bad experience,"Very bad experience, only the rooms are OK, but the service was very bad, no towels was in the bathroom and no soap, shampoo was provided. The morning breakfast was totally waste, only four items and no responsible person was not there in dining, so we have breakfast in nearby restaurant. Service, poor breakfast, no basic amenities, no response from reception, overall very bad experience.",1,29,,,,
Dee Cee Manor,Worst room & not recommended,"No hot water. Water was not flowing, no phone, one of the worst rooms they gave us. The staff is totally indifferent to our complaints and no courtesy.

Please remove this hotel from your website, it is a shame.",1,29,,,,

Dee Cee Manor,Horrible hotel & not recommended,This hotel is like a ghost house. There is light and ventilation. Cockroaches are adequately free for all guest in rooms. Found cat in the kitchen and no one is bothered. To drain water from the toilet takes 15 - 20 Mins. No AC was on in the lobby. I advise you to delist this hotel from your portfolio.,1,29,,,,
Dee Cee Manor,The Stay @ DEECEE MANOR,"The location of the hotel is good, The facility, cleanliness & service is hopeless. Not worth for the money paid. Need improvement in attending customers and responses. In addition they are charging extra Rs. 500 for no reason. Why?",2,43,,,,

Dee Cee Manor,Pathetic experience,"Pathetic to the core. It's utter waste of money. Don't get carried away by the photos. These guys are just cheating. Smelly rooms, pathetic service, Smelly bathrooms, the list goes on and on. Look for some other hotels.",1,29,,,,
Dee Cee Manor,Great option and value for money,We had come for Visa interview at US Consulate which is just 2 km from here. Great experience!! Worth for money. We had to pay Rs. 500 more for checking out 2 hrs late. Breakfast was good. Great option for those who come to US Consulate.,3,86,,,,

Dee Cee Manor,Spacious rooms & centrally located,"This good and old hotel once upon a time. Although, rooms is spacious, service was up keep etc. Not up to the standard to this tariff tag.

Still not totally worth the price being charged.",3,71,,,,

Kek Accommodation,,"I stayed here because I was arriving into Chennai after midnight. The free airport pick-up was the draw.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,My Stay at the Hyatt,"Air conditioning will need further maintenance. For a 5 star hotel my room was very musty and needed to be changed. In addition, the temperate gauges did NOT work on my air condo and thus the room was freezing.

For events, the staff was really good and cooperative",3,80,,,,

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Hotel in town,"Very comfortable, there was an excellent selection of breakfast and dinner. Watch out for overpriced bottles of water though! 

The staff were extremely helpful. 

 Lovely outdoor swimming pool - but very dark in the evenings - could do with better signage and lighting.",3,100,,,,
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Won't get back to this hotel,"Hotel is not a 5 starts hotel anymore.
The neighborhood is in construction so you can't get out by walking.
The hotel has a ballroom so they have parties every night and you can hear it in the room (7th floor).
Breakfast is mostly Indian, so if you don't like Indian food you're in trouble.
The free WI-Fi is lousy",2,60,,,,

Hyatt Regency Chennai,,"Most impressive service by staff in all areas. Good restaurants and fitness center. Beautiful hotel. Love the creative way the bathroom is set up that makes it both beautiful and functional. Love the many shelves in room and bathroom. However, the grout in the shower area looks like it needs some deep cleaning. Still, had a wonderful time at the hotel.",3,80,,,,
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Dissappointed,"The linens were smelling bad, and the elevators had a pungent odour. The housekeeping was not up to par of a 5 star hotel. They didn't clean the rooms regularly, I had a big argument with the housekeeping manager.

Doorman Syed and K. Subramani from Bell Services made my stay comfortable, even with these ordeals..",1,20,,,,
